#Intro
#Menu system
#Graphics system
#Combat system
#Collections:
#Locales
#Items - equippable/consumable
#Obstacles/enemies
#Stages (of progress) like STG001

#Graphical "memory"
#If my graphics are more than 1 pixel per entity, this could increase
#the size of lists by 2-16x massively slowing things down
#numpy for the array stuff to be faster?
#MVC model means graphics are technically superficial
#what size grid, then?
#7 rows for the menu, 15 columns for selection, 21 for text area?
#so 7x36 for lower part?
#23x36 for upper?
#30x36 = 1080 symbols.. Edit: NOPE
#ensure no gaps between lines for presentation consistency
#I had to expand this because I couldn't find a square font but it looks fine now
#So we're looking at 28x69 = 1932 symbols
#I hope this doesn't run like crap
#It appears that the console uses monospace font which does simplify things
#For reference: Functional space: 69x28 
#For reference, useable space: 
#Visuals box:67x20 #20 rows inside the border #66 because newline from join()
#Dialogue box:38x5 #5 rows inside the border #38 because newline from join()
#Menu box:27x5 #26 because of newline from join()
#For visual purposes, useable space:
#Visuals box:65x20
#Dialogue box:35x3 #Might move text to the visuals box as "popups" to increase space, and use the text box for stats and such
#Menu box:25x3 so perhaps up to 2 x 12 char strings

#How fast can this stuff even run?
# Perhaps store each row in a separate variable, list of lists?
#Figure out how to manipulate all the data without OOP

#character/enemy class system? yeesh maybe not yet, but it can be a variable with its own bonuses

#crit system

#Do I want dynamically updating text or just fresh output per "tick"?
#Decimal module for float errors?

#pandas?
#collections?

I want an elemental thing later..

#battle system:
#Loop: are enemies cleared or player dead yes/no
#loop: attack turn
#   loop: wait until turn complete
#       loop:   if player wait until move selected:
                menu selection:
                    move selection:
                        jab: base damage
                        bludgeon: base damage, 20% boost, 3% crit take 10% of damage dealt #maybe stamina? #maybe only backlash if using a blunt weapon?
                        special: base damage, +10% crit chance, +15% crit damage, 35% boost, 5% accuracy only once per day/revive
                        back: nothing, go back
                calculate damage
                deal damage
                pause for animation/damage text
                switch turn
# if player dead, revive in starting zone
# if enemies clearedspoils calculated off damage dealt/damage taken/rounds
#window 4 is needed
#how do I make a window disappear?
#

so goddamn much left to do, I need to update this into a damn to-do list
